# ClassMate
A python application which allows the user to input grades and track their progress in each class.

## What I Learned:
- Using tkinter module to implement a basic GUI in python with multiple pages
- Using sqlite module for persistent data entry and management 
- Making my own module (grades) to handle  data and keep the main file clean

## To Execute:
- Simply download grades.py, course.py, and main.py
- Run main.py
- classmate is a db file which contains data I was using to test my program. If you download this, you will start with preloaded courses.
